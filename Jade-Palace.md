# üèØ Jade Palace - 5 Weeks of Practices to Build "ScaleFu" System

## Overview

We are building a scalable Real-Time Registration Platform that can onboard thousands of users per second, eliminate duplicates instantly, and sustain high availability under peak loads, enhance our business processes, and provide a user-friendly interface for both users and internal staff.

## üêº ScaleFu Business Story

The Jade Palace is a popular shop in Thailand that has recently expanded its operations to include online membership registration. The shop has a large number of customers and wants to provide a seamless registration experience for them. The goal is to build a system that can handle high traffic, ensure data integrity, and provide a user-friendly interface for both users and internal staff.

## MVP Features

- User registration via Onboarder Service
- Admin page for user management
- User confirmation (email)


#### System Architecture

- **Onboarder Service**: Receives registration requests, validates input, and publishes to Kafka.
- **User Service**: Stores user data in PostgreSQL and triggers follow-ups.
- **Notifier Service**: Sends confirmation emails after successful registration.
- **Cache Updater**: Updates Redis cache with the latest user data.

Attack only by:

- High load (load testing / DDOS simulation).
- Trying invalid inputs (SQL injection, malformed payloads).
- Exploring bad API security or session bugs.
- No manual breaking (ssh-ing into other servers etc).
