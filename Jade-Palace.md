# üèØ Jade Palace - 5 Weeks of Practices to Build "ScaleFu" System

## Overview

We are building a scalable Real-Time Registration Platform that can onboard thousands of users per second, eliminate duplicates instantly, and sustain high availability under peak loads, enhance our business processes, and provide a user-friendly interface for both users and internal staff.

## üêº ScaleFu Business Story

The Jade Palace is a popular shop in Thailand that has recently expanded its operations to include online membership registration. The shop has a large number of customers and wants to provide a seamless registration experience for them. The goal is to build a system that can handle high traffic, ensure data integrity, and provide a user-friendly interface for both users and internal staff.

## MVP Features

- User registration via Onboarder Service
- Admin page for user management
- User confirmation (email)


#### System Architecture

- **Onboarder Service**: Receives registration requests, validates input, and publishes to Kafka.
- **User Service**: Stores user data in PostgreSQL and triggers follow-ups.
- **Notifier Service**: Sends confirmation emails after successful registration.
- **Cache Updater**: Updates Redis cache with the latest user data.

| Score | Description                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Not attempted                                  |
| 1     | Attempted but did not complete or understand   |

| 4     | Competent, able to execute independently       |
| 5     | Mastery, able to teach or improve others       |

### Formula for the Weighted Score of a Learning Outcome:

`Weighted Score of Learning Outcome = (Overall Score of Learning Outcome / Maximum Possible Score for Learning Outcome) * (Weight of the Week)`

Where:

* **Overall Score of Learning Outcome:** This is the score you assign (between 0 and 5 based on the rubric) that represents the overall competency for that specific learning outcome, potentially derived from the average or holistic assessment of its individual skills.
* **Maximum Possible Score for Learning Outcome:** This is the highest score achievable for that learning outcome on your rubric. In this case, it's 5.
* **Weight of the Week:** This is the percentage weight assigned to the week in which the learning outcome resides (e.g., 20% for Backend APIs, 15% for Frontend UI). Make sure to use the decimal form of the percentage (e.g., 20% = 0.20).

**Example using our previous scenario:**

Learning Outcome: Able to Build RESTful APIs with Go (from Week 1: Backend APIs, Weight: 20% or 0.20)
Overall Score of Learning Outcome: 3.5
Maximum Possible Score for Learning Outcome: 5

```code
Weighted Score of Learning Outcome = (3.5 / 5) * 0.20
                                    = 0.7 * 0.20
                                    = 0.14
```

This result (0.14) represents the weighted contribution of this specific learning outcome to the final grade. To get the final grade, you would perform this calculation for every learning outcome across all weeks and sum up the "Weighted Scores of Learning Outcome."

`Final Grade = Œ£ (Weighted Score of each Learning Outcome)`


Where Œ£ denotes the sum of all "Weighted Scores of Learning Outcome" across all weeks. The final grade will be a value between 0 and 1 (or 0% and 100% if you multiply by 100).

**Important Notes:**

* **Weighting within a Week (Optional):** If you want to give different learning outcomes within the same week different levels of importance, you could introduce a secondary weighting factor for each learning outcome within its week. This would make the formula more complex but allow for finer-grained control. For simplicity, the formula above assumes all learning outcomes within a week contribute equally to that week's overall weight based on their achieved score.
* **Consistency:** Ensure you consistently apply the scoring rubric across all skills and learning outcomes.
* **Interpretation:** The final grade will reflect the cumulative achievement across all learning outcomes, weighted by the importance of each week.

## Week 2: Provide UI for Admin to Manage Users

**Objective:**  
Provide a UI for internal staff to manage users, including viewing, updating, and deleting user information.

### Business Requirements

- Create a web-based UI for internal staff to manage users.
- The UI should allow staff to view a list of registered users.
- Staff should be able to view user details, including name, email, phone number, ID, and registration date.

### Technical Requirements
- Use the **Next.js** framework for the UI.
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- UI should be responsive and user-friendly.
- Implement authentication and authorization for staff access.

---

## Week 3: Deploy it to GCP Cloud with Network and Load Balancing

**Objective:**  
Deploy the backend API and frontend to GCP, configure the network, and set up load balancing for high availability.

### Key Activities
- Deploy backend API using **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**.
- Deploy the frontend UI using **Google Cloud Storage** (for static files) or **Google App Engine**.
- Set up **Google Cloud Load Balancer** to route traffic to the backend.
- Use **VPC** to configure the network and ensure secure communication between services.

---

## Week 4: Implement Security

**Objective:**  
Secure the backend API, frontend, and communications between services.

### Key Activities
- Implement **OAuth 2.0** or **JWT** for authentication and authorization.
- Set up **rate limiting** (e.g., 100 requests per minute per IP) to protect the API.
- Enable **HTTPS** using **SSL certificates** for secure communication.
- Use **Google Cloud IAM** to manage permissions.
- Implement **Firewall Rules** to restrict access to services.

---

## Week 5: System "Take Me Down" Tournament

**Objective:**  
Teams will try to stress test or find bugs in other teams' systems! (üèÜ)

<details> 
<summary>Rules</summary>
Attack only by:

- High load (load testing / DDOS simulation).
- Trying invalid inputs (SQL injection, malformed payloads).
- Exploring bad API security or session bugs.
- No manual breaking (ssh-ing into other servers etc).
- Document any weaknesses found.

Team with the most resilient system wins!
</details>

<details open> 
<summary>Technical Requirements</summary>

### Overview
Use tools like:
- **k6**, **Artillery.io** for load testing.
- **OWASP ZAP** for security testing.
- **Curl**, **Postman** for manual attempts.

### Monitor system health:
- CPU/Memory under load.
- Auto-scaling behavior.
- Error rates.

### Presentation:
Each team presents their findings and defense strategies.
