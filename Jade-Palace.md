| Week 1 | Backend APIs (All Core Features)                | Build all API endpoints: Register, User Management (CRUD). System flow after register (user "next steps" plan). Kafka, Redis, Postgres integration. | - `/api/v1/register` (POST) <br> - `/api/v1/users` (GET, PATCH, DELETE) <br> - Kafka events: user.registration, user.created, user.confirmation <br> - Redis cache setup. <br> - Database schema finalized. <br> - Complete user lifecycle in backend. |
| Week 2 | Frontend UI (Public Registration + Admin Panel) | Build 2 UIs: <br> ‚Ä¢ User: Public signup page. <br> ‚Ä¢ Admin: Dashboard to manage users (view, update status). Connect frontend to backend APIs.      | - Next.js app. <br> - Tailwind UI. <br> - User signup page (connects to `/register`). <br> - Admin dashboard (connects to `/users`). <br> - Basic authentication for admins.                                                                           |
| Week 3 | Deployment & Infrastructure (GCP Focus)         | Deploy backend + frontend on GCP. Use GCP Load Balancer, VPC, VM Instances / Kubernetes (flexible).

## Rules

1. Use `main` branch for development.
2. The system must be high-availability, reliable, scalable, secure, and easy to use.
3. Collaborate across teams and keep each team updated on progress. Complete each week‚Äôs objectives within the week.
4. Ensure all APIs are well-documented and follow best practices.
5. Executable documentation is required for all possible changes to the system.

## Week 1: Provide the API for Registration

**Objective:**  
Provide the backend API for user registration, manage input validation, and store the data in a database. Implement CRUD operations for user management.

### Business Requirements

- Create a registration API that allows new users to sign up.
- The API should accept user information such as name, email, phone number, and Thai ID.
- Validate the input data to ensure it meets the required format and criteria.
  - Name: 2 - 200 characters
  - Email: Valid email format
  - Phone number: Valid phone number format
  - Thai ID: Valid Thai ID format
- Users should receive a confirmation email after successful registration.
- The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent requests without crashing or slowing down.

### Technical Requirements

- Use a RESTful API design for the registration endpoint.
- Implement input validation using Go with the Gin framework.
- Unit test the API to ensure it works as expected.
- Integration test the API to ensure it works with the database and email service.
- Use PostgreSQL to store user information.
- Use Kafka for message queuing to handle high traffic.

### API Design Specification

#### Onboarder Service

- Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/register`
  - Request Body:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "string",
      "email": "string",
      "phoneNumber": "string",
      "thaiID": "string"
    }
    ```
  - Response:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "message": "Registration successful",
      "data": {
        "userID": "string"
      }
    }
    ```
  - Error Response:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "error",
      "message": "Invalid input data"
    }
    ```

#### System Architecture

- **Onboarder Service**: Receives registration requests, validates input, and publishes to Kafka.
- **User Service**: Stores user data in PostgreSQL and triggers follow-ups.
- **Notifier Service**: Sends confirmation emails after successful registration.
- **Cache Updater**: Updates Redis cache with the latest user data.

```

## Week 2: Provide UI for Admin to Manage Users

**Objective:**  
Provide a UI for internal staff to manage users, including viewing, updating, and deleting user information.

### Business Requirements
- Create a web-based UI for internal staff to manage users.
- The UI should allow staff to view a list of registered users.
- Staff should be able to view user details, including name, email, phone number, ID, and registration date.

### Technical Requirements
- Use the **Next.js** framework for the UI.
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- UI should be responsive and user-friendly.
- Implement authentication and authorization for staff access.

## Week 3: Deploy it to GCP Cloud with Network and Load Balancing

**Objective:**  
Deploy the backend API and frontend to GCP, configure the network, and set up load balancing for high availability.

### Key Activities
- Deploy backend API using **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**.
- Deploy the frontend UI using **Google Cloud Storage** (for static files) or **Google App Engine**.
- Set up **Google Cloud Load Balancer** to route traffic to the backend.
- Use **VPC** to configure the network and ensure secure communication between services.

---

## Week 4: Implement Security

**Objective:**  
Secure the backend API, frontend, and communications between services.

### Key Activities
- Implement **OAuth 2.0** or **JWT** for authentication and authorization.
- Set up **rate limiting** (e.g., 100 requests per minute per IP) to protect the API.
- Enable **HTTPS** using **SSL certificates** for secure communication.
- Use **Google Cloud IAM** to manage permissions.
- Implement **Firewall Rules** to restrict access to services.

---

## Week 5: System "Take Me Down" Tournament

**Objective:**  
Teams will try to stress test or find bugs in other teams' systems! (üèÜ)

<details> 
<summary>Rules</summary>
Attack only by:

- High load (load testing / DDOS simulation).
- Trying invalid inputs (SQL injection, malformed payloads).
- Exploring bad API security or session bugs.
- No manual breaking (ssh-ing into other servers etc).
- Document any weaknesses found.

Team with the most resilient system wins!

<summary>Technical Requirements</summary>

### Overview
Use tools like:
- **k6**, **Artillery.io** for load testing.
- **OWASP ZAP** for security testing.
- **Curl**, **Postman** for manual attempts.

### Monitor system health:
- CPU/Memory under load.
- Auto-scaling behavior.
- Error rates.

### Presentation:
Each team presents their findings and defense strategies.
